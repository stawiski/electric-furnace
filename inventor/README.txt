This project was made in Autodesk Inventor Professional 2015 student version.
I have named the objects as they are in my location.

The purpose of this 3D assembly was to visualize how to position the elements, how many to buy, etc.
It's not a full furnace with heating wire, wire supports and other precise elements.
